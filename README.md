# Twitter's new UI is fugly

...but worry not, it can be helped. If you use a desktop browser, that is.

## Follow buttons

With the new UI, the Follow/Unfollow buttons changed: where previously a filled button indicated following and an empty button not following, the roles are now reversed. If you wish to preserve the old button behaviour, import `twitter_follow_buttons.user.css` into the custom CSS plugin of your choice. Supports custom accent colours (set manually, default options provided) as well as dim and lights out mode.

## Navbar

The currently selected item on the navigation sidebar is pretty hard to make out. At least for _Home_, _Explore_, _Notifications_, _Messages_, and _Bookmarks_, that can be easily fixed: import `twitter_navbar.user.css`. supports custom accent colours.
